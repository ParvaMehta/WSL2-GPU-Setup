This repository covers the process I followed to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) with GPU acceleration on Windows 11 Enterprise using an NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU.
It outlines steps for installing NVIDIA drivers, setting up CUDA in Ubuntu, and enabling GPU usage within WSL.

Note: Despite following these steps, I encountered issues with GPU performance, particularly while running virtualized environments.
The GPU acceleration didnâ€™t function as expected, likely due to conflicts in how virtualized graphics were being handled in my setup.
Further troubleshooting is needed for full GPU utilization in WSL under a virtualized environment.

Here's the List of Practicls i have done using windows 11  Enterpris (Hyper VM)
Verifying WSL 2 Installation  (one)
Setting Up CUDA in WSL 2 (two)
Enabling GPU Support in WSL 2 (three)
Running GPU-Accelerated Applications (four)

Experiment (Failed)
